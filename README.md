# Hired

A small website to search for jobs

I learnt

EJS and how to apply HTML string 
Passing data from front to back end using forms
Making API calls 
Styling using Bootstrap and CSS
Keeping structure, styling, and functionality as separate as I can


What I need to learn more about is

Styling, mostly because this becomes a massive time sink.
Databases, how to use them and how do they factor into websites
Pagination. I've kept the numbers small on this website, but I would have liked to learn how to do it. I need a database, but I'm not sure. 

I'd like to get better at polishing CSS here. It's good but I still struggle to get it to look like I want it to. 


This app uses Express and NPM nodes
It makes API calls to REED and UDEMY 

P.S

I need to learn why my images aren't loading. I'm guessing it's something to do with the filepath... 

Problems I've encountered.
I've learnt that I need to hide my API keys and client secrets. 

I've tried to do this and use the website OnRender however I can't seem to get it to work. I think I'm doing something wrong with initialising the secret variables.
I keep getting an API request error, so the API key isn't correct. 

I tried to use it without using secret variables. But it still is getting a bad request error. It works on my local host but somehow the error is coming when I upload to the Git Hub. Unsure here.

Update 01/08
I'm still trying to get the .env to work. I seem to be getting /n at the end of my auth. I don't understand why, this seems to be a line break? or new line? but why is it coming and still doesn't explain why it doesn't work if I don't use the .env and just put in the codes. 

Annoying that I can't get it to upload.... ah well, that's why I'm learning
