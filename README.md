# Hired

A small website to search for jobs

I learnt

EJS and how to apply HTML string 
Passing data from front to back end using forms
Making API calls 
Styling using Bootstrap and CSS
Keeping structure, styling, and functionality as separate as I can


What I need to learn more about is

Styling, mostly because this becomes a massive time sink.
Databases, how to use them and how do they factor into websites
Pagination. I've kept the numbers small on this website, but I would have liked to learn how to do it. I need a database, but I'm not sure. 

I'd like to get better at polishing CSS here. It's good but I still struggle to get it to look like I want it to. 


This app uses Express and NPM nodes
It makes API calls to REED and UDEMY 

P.S

I need to learn why my images aren't loading. I'm guessing it's something to do with the filepath...
